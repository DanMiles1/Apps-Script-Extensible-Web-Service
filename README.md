Google Apps Script to create an Extensible Web Service for Google Sheets

Google Sheets is a great service for storing and manipulating data in the cloud and can be a simple back-end for your IoT, Mobile or Web Application projects. Google Apps Script makes it easy to build up complex functionality and expose your Sheets as a REST Web service to integrate with your projects.

The script allows you to make an extensible web service to allow your projects to use Google Sheets as a back-end database.
